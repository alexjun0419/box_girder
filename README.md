## Prediction Model for Damage of Box-Grider Seat-Type Ordinary Bridge Structures
This work was done for the Prediction Model for Damage of Box-Girder Seat Type Ordinary Bridge Structures project. This project attempts to predict the damage done to bridge columns due to earthquakes, given some information about the earthquake's parameters, intensity measures, and the geometry of the columns. The final prediction models include a Neural Network and Generalized Additive Models, the results of which can be seen in gam_and_data.qmd.
